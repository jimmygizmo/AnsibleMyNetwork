Router 2911
Switch 2960-24TT

CLI on 2911 router: (example is over mgmt port (VLAN) interface as no ethernet is up yet)

"... just go to the USER PRIVILEGED MODE (enable) and the GLOBAL CONFIGURATION MODE (configure terminal)..."

> enable

> configure terminal

LOG FROM EMULATOR - IOS CLI:

Router#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Router(config)#interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
Router(config-if)#no shutdown

Router(config-if)#
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up

%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up

********* NOTE: We entered a config sort of edit mode and 'no shutdown' although
the name is not aligned with the action, seems to be how to activate the new
config, bring the IF up and exit the config mode as we arrive after a few ENTERs
at the earlier prompt of just:

Next we assign IP addresses as currently we cannot access the router or 
switch from the laptop via any of the physically linked interfaces which
are now working at the physical layer (1). I would think they are also working
at the the Data Link Layer (2) , but not at the Network Layer (3), until we perform the next steps.
-- Actually perhaps since we have specific ports connected and working physically
then we might also have a working Network Layer (3) since that has to do with
the 'physical path' and I would say our ethernet physical connections have
established that. The next layer up is layer 4, the Transport Layer and that has
to do with Data Transmission using protocols such as TCP and UDP, and we
know that will not happen without assigning IP addresses, well at least not
for full data transmission. Some broadcast packets would of course be arriving.

We have selected some addresses and ranges:
2911 Router 0 -- 10.10.1.1/28

2960-24TT Switch 0 -- VLAN1: 10.10.1.10/28

Laptop-PT Laptop 0 -- 10.10.1.2/28
