UPDATE:
Working well so far but have not yet connected to anything from
outside:
VMWare Fusion running GNS3 VM on macOS, upgrade to latest vers
on everything from above video.
GNS3 connects to VM and works well with one known warning about
not being on the same network.
Found and importes two Cisco router images from unoffical sources
after virus scanning them. (* Cisco makes it far too difficult
to obtain official images from them from simply doing some
dev automation or test work.) But there were no errors importing,
instantiating and starting those.
Also successfully downloaded a template for Network Automation
from GNS3 matketplace but the comments section for it indicate
a lot of issues and it looks like little more than a containerized
Ansible but also includes 3 other automation packages which
I started looking at closely.

The real proof that GNS3 will be very valuable for my plan to use
it for targeting automation dev/test is when I can connect to
it and/or when/if I can mount an externally-maintained Ansible
inside of it (for similar goals.)

My guess is this will be possible and I may acheive that shortly.
The CPU usage is a bit high, well it is very high, but not to
the extreme and may prove to be workable even on an older
laptop.
A cheap gaming PC might be a great option to run GNS3 locally.
It looks like and incredibly powerful tool for Network
professionals.
