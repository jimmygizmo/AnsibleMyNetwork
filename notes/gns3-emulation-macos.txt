# GNS3 - Probably not usable on MacOS when Wifi is eth0. Possibly usable when eth0 is wired.
# Best option is GNS3 but probably on a physical windows/PC host - NOT inside another VM like in the cloud.
# RECOMMEND: Try a medium-power windows/PC host on physical ethernet .. then GNS3 might be amazing.
# GNS3 looks amazing, but macOS Wifi has limitiations (security protection) on interface use that seems not
#  to be possible to overcome.

**** UPDATE: I have now tried or investigated many of the options in-depth with the goal of connecting to emulated devices
from the given emulation environment. This is not readily supported and/or working in the two main free
options for personal systems (local laptop or on the metal host machine): Cisco Packet Trace and GNS3.
Extensive worked failed to acheive outside connectivity over wireless at least. There is still some possibility
of using physical ethernet, but at that point it might make sense to bring up a cheap PC.
Yes, PHYSICAL host, not a VM instance locally or in the cloud. You still have to run a VM, probably VMWare
Fusion, but you really cannot run this inside another Hypervisor. GN3 is not well suited for nested virtualization.
So, there is some hope but it is NOT EASY to emulate networking devices for developement, such as for automation
dev or test targets, which is what I need for this project.

----
EARLIER UPDATE:
Working well so far but have not yet connected to anything from
outside:
VMWare Fusion running GNS3 VM on macOS, upgrade to latest vers
on everything from above video.
GNS3 connects to VM and works well with one known warning about
not being on the same network.
Found and importes two Cisco router images from unoffical sources
after virus scanning them. (* Cisco makes it far too difficult
to obtain official images from them from simply doing some
dev automation or test work.) But there were no errors importing,
instantiating and starting those.
Also successfully downloaded a template for Network Automation
from GNS3 matketplace but the comments section for it indicate
a lot of issues and it looks like little more than a containerized
Ansible but also includes 3 other automation packages which
I started looking at closely.

The real proof that GNS3 will be very valuable for my plan to use
it for targeting automation dev/test is when I can connect to
it and/or when/if I can mount an externally-maintained Ansible
inside of it (for similar goals.)

My guess is this will be possible and I may acheive that shortly.
The CPU usage is a bit high, well it is very high, but not to
the extreme and may prove to be workable even on an older
laptop.
A cheap gaming PC might be a great option to run GNS3 locally.
It looks like and incredibly powerful tool for Network
professionals.
