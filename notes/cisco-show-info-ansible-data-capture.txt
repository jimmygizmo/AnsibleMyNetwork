* This example was done on a Cisco router, but the lib looks like general purpose
  'expect' over ssh or something very similar. basic command composing and response
  parsing with CLI-related features.

   - name: capture show output
     hosts: routers
     gather_facts: no
     connection: network_cli

     tasks:
        - name: show run
         ios_command:
           commands:
           - show run
           - show ip route
           - show ip eigrp neighbors
           - show version
         register: config

       - name: save output to local directory
         copy:
           content: "{{ config.stdout | replace('\\n', '\n') }}"
         dest: "show-output/{{ inventory_hostname }}.ios"
 ...

IN GENERAL, network_cli:
COLLECTION: ansible.netcommon

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/netcommon/network_cli_connection.html

** This is included in ansible core:
ansible.netcommon             4.1.0
**** It looks like this might be like a form of 'expect', for general purpose command
  and response over ssh.
