This is more of an interesting aside, which should be used for any playbook sets for linux hosts.
Sometimes there are reasons too look at iptables on your linux host.
For example, although I have never had any problems with this, I have looked closely at it while troubleshooting
some difficult networking issues (which turned out to be a silly problem in the end but not until a lot
of complex troubleshooting ruled out many possible causes as you sometimes are forced to do.) .. so the
context in my story is one of Docker, Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
Docker Enginer does some interesting things with iptables to make Docker Networking work.
And Docker Networking always works really well for me, so there is no trouble here.
BUT .. if you are stuck on a networking problem, you might be looking at EVERYTHING and you most certainly might
look closely at something which adds a lot of things to your iptables.

To make a very long story short .. I have some playbooks which collect all possible useful information from a
Linux host. I will be sure to add this step, to display iptables entries, to my general info playbooks:

printf "\n#### ####  iptables -nvL  -----  PRE DOCKER STARTUP\n"
iptables -nvL

..... something like Docker starting up happens here. Anything that might manipulate iptables that you want to
..... investigate.


printf "\n#### ####  iptables -nvL  -----  POST DOCKER STARTUP\n"
iptables -nvL


# This note file and the tasks it refers to definitly belong over in my other Ansible project:
# AnsibleMyEC2, which has much more to do with Linux hosts than this Network Automation project.
