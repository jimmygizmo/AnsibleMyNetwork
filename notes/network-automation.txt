These notes cover research sources for Ansible network automation and also simulate network devices to use for
automation development and similar topics. The goal is to develop some useful playbooks for common routure and
load balancer tasks on mostly Cisco equipment. Goals may expand later beyond this focus.

GITHUB PROJECT: CONTAINERS RUNNING POPULAR ROUTERS AND OTHER NETWORKING APPLIANCES (SIMULATED)
For labs for automation or CI/CD development.
https://github.com/vrnetlab/vrnetlab

Cisco routers available to simulate: (they have a handful from other vendors as well)
------------------------------------
Cisco CSR1000v
Cisco Nexus NX-OS (using Titanium emulator)
Cisco XRv
Cisco XRv 9000

A good article on this project and using it for automation:

EXCELLENT: GNS3 Article: ** NOTE This is from 2014 but still worth a close look.

Interesting links, less-directly relevant.
Generally, using Cisco Packet Trace is very valuable. ** I'm looking to see if it is possible to automate against
emulated devices running inside Packet Trace .. FROM THE OUTSIDE. That would be amazing. Then I could develop
Ansible from a VE or a container and operate against nearly-real devices in a nearly-real simulated network.
I'm hoping this is possible and I will updated here as I investigate.
TODO: Update on the ability to connect from the outside, in to devices emulated inside Cisco Packet Trace.

SEEMS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE .. BUT REQUIRES INTERFACE (PROBABLY ON LINUX) IN PROMUSCIOUS MODE. (KERNEL)

* NOTE: There are many other emulation/simulation options to automate/test/dev against, but some have special
hardware requirements, such as needing a physical Linux or Windows host to run on. Others require a paid license.

**** UPDATE: I have now tried or investigated many of the options in-depth with the goal of connecting to emulated devices
from the given emulation environment. This is not readily supported and/or working in the two main free
options for personal systems (local laptop or on the metal host machine): Cisco Packet Trace and GNS3.
Extensive worked failed to acheive outside connectivity over wireless at least. There is still some possibility
of using physical ethernet, but at that point it might make sense to bring up a cheap PC.
Yes, PHYSICAL host, not a VM instance locally or in the cloud. You still have to run a VM, probably VMWare
Fusion, but you really cannot run this inside another Hypervisor. GN3 is not well suited for nested virtualization.
So, there is some hope but it is NOT EASY to emulate networking devices for developement, such as for automation
dev or test targets, which is what I need for this project.
