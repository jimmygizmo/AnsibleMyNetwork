My GNS3 update on usage of router or switch images for CLI automation development:
Prior efforts were focused on getting networking to working between inside the GNS emilated topology and the
local network of the host/laptop and/or even better, other hosts on the outside (LAN mostly) for automation
development. But GNS3 promises to be amazing for so many things, but alas getting things to work is a real
uphill battle, in many cases probably not worth the effort in the midst of so much undocumented complexity and
buggy hit-or-miss behavior with additional platform-specific (macOS, WiFi) challenges. Using GNS3 to it's full
potential seems practically impossible or at the least it takes so much time and effort that a paid alternative
is looking attractive now. GNS3 was the last free hope. It is still very valuable and useful, but I am finding
myself searching for the small parts of it which do work and totally abandoning larger more complex goals because
each step is very challenging or impossible to get working so far. Only small parts work in limited scenarios,
especially if you are relying on sort of random (but virus scanned) device images from around the Internet.
Again, the paywalls in this area of technology are really a huge barrier to learning, but that seems to be the
way it is. This is not an open source ecosystem. It seems even the tools for learning all require licenses and
payment, especially for Cisco.

I tried images for 4 Cisco routers, just trying to use the CLI over console/telnet. Only one worked.
Three others just hung at the 'Press ENTER to get prompt.' which seems to be the stopping point for a lot of people.

TODO: Update here with a link to the one that worked. No point linking the others until perhaps they can be made
to work. So all three of the "bad" ones all hang after the telnet connection establishment output (6-10 lines) that
says 'Press ENTER to get prompt.' The routers for which I could not get my (questionable) images to work were:
c3600, c3725, c3745

The image that works is for this model: c7200
So let's look closer at this model for a second. Sold through 2015, supported through 2019, first sold pre 1999 possibly.
"The Cisco 7200 Series Routers, including the 7201, 7202, 7204, 7204VXR, 7206, and 7206VXR models, are no longer supported."
But these have had a LONG run and so are probably a great choice to learn from. Look like mid to large corporate usage.

ASIDE: A TRIED AND TRUE AUTOMATION METHOD - PYTHON AND EXPECT OVER SSH (CISCO EXAMPLE):
https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/2014/07/26/scripting-a-cisco-switch-with-python-and-expect/

Nice to see an example and confirmation of what I know. Anything that can be typed and read from responses,
can be fully automated with Python and Expect and similar strategies which emulate the operator manually
configuring the device using its native CLI and typing commands and reacting to responses over an SSH or Telnet
comnnection.

* This was just an aside, relevant to Cisco, but now back to the specifics on the CLI on the 7200
