Ansible's official repositories have a wealth of stuff for both playbooks, and Python applications and modules
integrating YAML and playbooks .. with lots and lots of device and vendor specific plays etc.

AnsibleMyNetwork is at the point to move from the BASH/ZSH run scripts (which are nice and simple and will not
be eliminated) .. into more powerful Python command line tools for running playbooks and more. This is just the
natural progression.

Because of the richness of Python code I see in the Ansible repositories for Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and obviously
many other vendors, I find it to be perfect timing to start looking a lot closer at these repositories as I
start writing some Python tools.

I will not be re-inventing the wheel. When I see something really good in the existing Ansible ecosystem, I will
leverage it in this project appropriately. However, I have many reasons for writing my own playbooks as I do,
even if they are a direct adaptation of something pre-existing
in Ansible's repos or other sources, so I may continue to do that, which would not be re-inventing the wheel.
My tendency is to apply additional levels of organization to playbooks, to enhance their meaningful verbosity, to
add a standardized approach to outbout and debugging, variable names, playbook and task names and much more.
There is a lot of value in this, especially when it is time to add higher level abstractions (cmd line tools and
integration points for Ansible Tower for example) and such, which leverage things like good systematic naming
conventions. On top of these goals, this is a great way for me to personally learn more about the powerful
Ansible ecosystem, while adding my own style of value.

These are the Ansible Collections repositories I am most interested in, in order of relevance to me for
the current work here in AnsibleMyNetwork:
