# AnsibleMyNetwork



### Ansible automation for setup, configuration, maintenance and operation of Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and Checkpoint devices.

#### This project is brand new and in rough/early stubout condition, but with some valuable notes from initial dev work and research.

The first playbooks and run scripts and more will be pushed in a day or two.

I'm still ramping up device similators/emulators to test/dev against, while capturing some essential automation steps and commands as I explore the simulators I want to use.

TODO: Incorporate this intro text taken from the AnsibleMyEC2 README.md where this project lived for its first few days:


Goals for the new Network Device Automation playbooks: Manage firewall rules for rapid/frequent response to threat activity. Control Load Balancer configuration for blue/green software deployment. Enable general automation of Cisco IOS devices and those of the most popular vendors. The scope of the resulting project is still being planned.
